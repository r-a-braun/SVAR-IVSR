The code stored in this folder replicates the analysis conducted in section 3.1: "The importance of oil supply shocks for driving oil prices".

1) To replicate the main analysis of the paper, first run "Runme_Models_Main.m". This code will generate raw MCMC output of the SVAR models used throughout the section. This can take a fairly long time.

2) Once step 1) is completed, Table 1 can be computed running "Compute_Table_1_Main.m", and Table 2 can be computed running 
"Compute_Table_2_Main.m".
