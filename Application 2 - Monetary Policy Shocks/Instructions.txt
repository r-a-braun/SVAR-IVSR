The code stored in this folder replicates the analysis conducted in section 3.2: "The effects of monetary policy", and supplementary results of online appendix H.2.

1) To replicate the main analysis of the paper, first run "Runme_Models_Main.m". This code will generate raw MCMC output of the SVAR models identified by schemes R1, R2 and R3 and save it into the results folder. This will take a fairly long time - particularly for model R2 where we draw a large number from both posterior and prior. The reason is that we need a very long sample to get reliable Bayes Factors analysis.

2) To plot Figure 1, run "Plot_Figure_1_Main.m". The code will use the MCMC output to create IRFs which are then plotted.

3) To compute the Bayes Factor testing if the Romer and Romer instrument is exogenous under model R2, run "Compute_Bayes_Factor.m". Note that with each MCMC run - a different estimate will arise which is why it is unlikely that the number reported in the paper (2*BF=14.5) will be matched exactly.

------------------- APPENDIX H.2 ------------------------------

1) To compute Table 5 of the Appendix (Posterior distribution for parameters of the policy rule), run "Compute_Table_5_Appendix.m"

2) To compute Figure 3 of the Appendix, first run the augmented models "Runme_Models_Appendix.m". Then run "Plot_Figure_3_Appendix.m".
